					<h2>JETSApp (Job Estimating &#38 Tracking Systems Application)</h2>
						
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->		
						
						<h3>Overview</h3>
						
						<p>There is an increasing need to automate small business operations in today’s market, that can aid efficient production.</p>
						<p>One industry that could benefit largely from such automation, are small businesses in the construction industry.</p>
						<p>This project will target the job quoting and estimation process of the Painting and Decorating Trade within the construction industry, where many calculations are required from the gathering of data during the quoting or estimating period. </p>
						<p>The development of a business application that can process this data in real time and present an immediate quote or estimate to a potential client will provide opportunities for the business owner to improve on customer relationships, job stability, general business practices and also has the added benefit of a better quality of personal life outside of work.</p>
						<p>Although this project will target the Painting and Decorating Trade within the construction industry specifically, there may also be an opportunity to expand this business application to other areas within the construction industry as well, that display similar traits and parameters.</p>
						
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->						
						<h3>Motivation</h3>
						
						<p>I have personally operated as a small painting and decorating business owner within the construction industry and have been through the job quoting and estimation process many times. </p>
						<p>This process could be very time consuming and draining personally, so a more efficient means of conducting this part of the business would be most welcome.</p>
						<p>Producing a job quote or estimate, came in two parts:<br>
							1.	The initial gathering of data (i.e. measurements, parameters etc); followed by<br>
							2.	Processing that data to calculate the finished job quotation or estimate.
						</p>
						<p>Processing the data was usually done off site (i.e. back at home) when time permitted. This process had two major pitfalls:<br>
							1.	The “I’ll get to it later” attitude was a real threat after already exhausting days; and<br>
							2.	Occasionally missing or forgetting certain data or parameters of the job whilst onsite that could potentially underquote jobs.
						</p>
						<p>The development of a business application to mitigate or eliminate these threats altogether, will improve the life/work balance of the user, and provide a more stable pricing structure of jobs that can be monitored and improved.</p>

						<h3>Tools &#38 Technologies</h3>
						
							<p>This business application will be cloud based and accessible to any user with access to the internet and compatible mobile device.</p>
							<p>Therefore, development of the operating system (software), is the primary factor in the successful development and maintenance of the application.</p>
							<p>* Note<br>
							Although using the JETSApp can be used via a smartphone and uploaded/sent immediately on submission to the potential client, a larger tablet may be more beneficial when conducting the quoting and estimating process should the user want to create a better experience for the customer and show progress of the application in real time. 
							</p>
						
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->								
						<h3>Skills Required</h3>
							
							<p>JETSApp requires two key components for success:<br>
							1.	Technical expertise of the painting trade to help guide the appropriate development of items; and<br>
							2.	The development of written software.<br>
							</p>
							<p>Current Skills<br>
							Personal expertise in the painting trade which will guide the appropriate development of items<br>
							</p>
							<p>Skill Shortfall<br>
							No experience programming or developing software<br>
							</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->								
						<h3>Outcome</h3>	
						
							<p>If this business application is successful in mitigating or even eliminating the two major threats of the job quoting and estimation process, the impact of this development has many major benefits in both business operations as well as on a personal level.</p>
						
						
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->								
						<h3>Major Business Impacts</h3>	
						
							<p>•	A systemised job/estimation process enables the user the ability to monitor certain variables within the system, which can be monitored and improved upon<br>
							•	A better pricing system will help improve business stability<br>
							•	A better pricing system will allow for the manipulation of data variables to increase business profitability<br>
							•	Improved profitability often leads to a better quality of work through improved or more efficient business practices<br>
							</p>
						
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->								
						<h3>Major Personal Impacts</h3>	
						
							<p>•	Improved emotional stability with the ability to “switch off” after returning home from work<br>
							•	More time outside of work for personal pursuits<br>
							•	A better work/life balance overall<br>
							</p>					
						
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->								
						<h3>Overall Impact</h3>	
												
							<p>Overall, having more time to chase or develop interests whether it be in business, or of a personal nature, can only have a positive impact on the user for many years to come.</p>
