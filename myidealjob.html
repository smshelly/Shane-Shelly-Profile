					<h2>Journey to Becoming a Cloud Solutions Architect</h2>
						
						<img src="images/idealJob.png" width="531" height="1585" alt=""/>
						
						<h3>Job Description</h3>
						
							<p>This job asks for someone to help detail and develop cloud solutions and systems for an innovative and emerging start-up company.
							I love the idea of being involved in something that is emerging, or in a rapid growth stage, as I am very entrepreneurial at heart and enjoy seeing things grow from the ground up.
							</p>
						
						<h3>Skills, Qualifications &#38 Experience Required</h3>
							<h4>Skills</h4>
								<p>Knowledge in building and migrating applications, software and services on AWS and Azure platforms.<br>
								Writing custom scripts (coding) to increase efficiency.<br>
								Designing solutions to align with the business’ interests and goals.<br>
								Infrastructure analysis and anomaly detection.<br>
								Performance and security monitoring.
								</p>
							<h4>Qualifications</h4>
								<p>Although most skills may be learnt outside of a formal education, a bachelor’s degree in IT would most likely be the minimal requirement.
								</p>
							<h4>Experience Required</h4>
								<p>This job essentially requires experience above all others in the design, implementation and deployment of cloud solutions through the integration of various technologies and applications not limited to AWS or Azure services, and working with DevOps and Agile methodologies.
								</p>
						<h3>Skills, Qualifications &#38 Experience Shortfall</h3>
								<p>With essentially no experience in Information Technology through previous study or work, my shortfalls in the skills, qualifications and experience required for this position are significant.								
								</p>
						<h3>Overcoming the Required Skills, Qualifications &#38 Experience Shortfall</h3>
								<p>Much of the necessary skills required for this position can be obtained through a structured course of higher learning such as that of a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT with which I am currently enrolled.
								Forming a solid foundation in programming, computer systems, software engineering, networks and security in the early stages of my degree will serve as a precursor for specialising in cloud services and computing in years 2 and 3 along with minor studies in networking.
								</p>
								<p>Finally, overcoming the experience factor is unfortunately only possible with time served in employment within the required areas that are applicable to the job.
							
								</p>
